# Tic-Tac-Toe Game 🎮  

This is my first project using JavaScript: a classic Tic-Tac-Toe game! The game lets two players compete in a simple and intuitive interface, with clear game mechanics and real-time win detection.  

## Features:  
- 🕹️ **Two-player mode**: Play locally with a friend.  
- ✅ **Win detection**: Highlights the winning line when a player wins.  
- 🔄 **Restart option**: Reset the game board to play again.  
- 🖥️ **Responsive design**: Enjoy on desktop or mobile.  

## Technologies Used:  
- **HTML**: For the structure of the game.  
- **CSS**: To style the board and provide a clean user interface.  
- **JavaScript**: The logic behind the gameplay and interactivity.  

## Future Enhancements:  
- Finish server side handling
- 📊 Track scores across multiple rounds. 
- 🎯 Add an AI opponent for single-player mode.  
- 🌟 Improve the design with animations and custom themes.
